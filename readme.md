#Blog(wt)

---

Blog(wt) is a Laravel 4.2 powered multi-author blogging platform focused on simplicity. It provides:

  - RBAC (Admins, Authors, Moderators, Users)
  - User Administration
  - Public and Private (account required) Articles
  - Seamless transition between viewing and editing content
  - Ability to arrange and filter content by category and tags
  - Built-in Comments with moderation based on RBAC settings (also includes auto-disable)
  - Absolutely nothing new that thousands of other platforms provide... just tailored to my liking

The true goal of Blog(wt) is to provide a platform that includes nifty features like multi-authors, moderators, content filtering with categories and tags, comments with moderation abilities, and other fun blog-must-haves but without requiring the user to jump OUT of their content and into some separate "Admin" portal. That transition feels wonky to me, so Blog(wt) simply gives various options on the page you're viewing based on your access level. Pretty choice, if you ask me.

This is a work in progress and was primarily developed over a single weekend. As such, there's still a long way to go.


### Installation Instructions

Don't. It's not ready yet.

### Upcoming features
 - User Profiles: Currently an email and password is all you get. This will include use of Gravatar and more optionally provided details (Target: v1.7.0)
 - Complete Front-end Overhaul: Well, to be honest, there isn't much of a front-end right now... so maybe "Overhaul" is inaccurate. Up until now the focus has been function. This step will focus on form. (Target: v2.0.0)
