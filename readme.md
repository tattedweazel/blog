#Blog (working title)

---

Blog is a Laravel 4.2 powered multi-author blogging platform focused on simplicity. It provides:

  - RBAC (Admins, Authors, Moderators, Users)
  - User Administration
  - Public and Private (account required) Articles
  - Seamless transition between viewing and editing content
  - Ability to arrange and filter content by category
  - Absolutely nothing new that thousands of other platforms provide... just tailored to my linking

The true goal of Blog is to provide a platform that includes nifty features like multi-authors, moderators, content filtering, and other fun blog-must-haves but without requiring the user to jump OUT of their content and into some separate "Admin" portal. That transition feels wonky to me, so Blog simply gives various options on the page you're viewing based on your access level. Pretty choice, if you ask me.

This is a work in progress and was primarily developed over a single weekend. As such, there's still a long way to go.
